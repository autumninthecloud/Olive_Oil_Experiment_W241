```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## This code will perform complete randomization on participants who have not yet been assigned to treatment or control groups. It will also perform a simple binary randomization on participants who have not yet been assigned to take either olive oil #1 or #2 first. 

```{r import data}
library(readxl)
library(data.table)
data <- read_excel("./Olive Oil Experiment Participant List_2_25_22.xlsx", sheet = 'Sheet1', skip = 2, col_names = TRUE)
data <- data.table(data)
head(data)
```

```{r random assignment to treatment and control}
needs_azzignment <- data[is.na(azzignment) == TRUE]
head(needs_azzignment)

```
