### Abstract
Do positive marketing messages influence a consumer’s preference of a product? Many experiments have
been conducted on how expectations influence perception. These experiments have shown that people’s level
of enjoyment is impacted by the cues that they are given before consumption. To examine this theory, we
conducted The Olive Oil Taste Test, a two-factor deception design field experiment. Participants were asked
to taste two samples of the same olive oil in a randomized order under the guise the oils were different.
Participants in treatment were given a marketing message regarding one of the olive oil samples, indicating
it was superior in quality. Participants in control were given an alternative factual message. We performed
analysis using linear regression in R Studio. The results of our experiment show that participants do not tend
to favor an olive oil with a marketing message. This outcome leads us to conclude that marketing messages
do not have an effect on a consumer’s enjoyment of a product. However, there are reasons to remain skeptical
about these results. The most important reason being a low powered experiment, given the small sample size
and lukewarm marketing message. Despite our results, we believe that it may be worthwhile to reproduce
this experiment with a large sample and a potent marketing message to produce more robust results.
